As a data scientist and musician, my long-term objective is to innovatively enliven human communication through **an emotion-driven algorithmic composition system**. I aim to enhance individuals’ ability to convey unspoken sentiments through music, thereby helping them overcome expressive limitations and alleviate mental anguish. Therefore, my research interests underlie the intersection of high-level music technology and data science, including but not limited to computational analysis and inference of human music perception and cognition, music information retrieval, similarity learning, cross-modal feature integration, algorithmic composition and orchestration, and automatic annotation.
